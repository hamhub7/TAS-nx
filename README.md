# TAS-nx

This program runs simple scripts from the SD card and exectutes the inputs at the press of a button.

Sample scripts are provided with the program. Refer to the /scripts directory in the source code to see them.
To add a script, place the script (modeled exactly like the ones in the examples) in the /scripts folder on your root. Name the script script[number].txt where [number] can range from 0-9 and has no brackets.
To run the script, connect a USB keyboard to your docked switch and press the corresponding number key to activate the script.
NOTE: Sometimes the scripts like to drop the first input of the script, and this can sometimes cause large desyncs. I recommend starting the script on frame 1 instead of frame 0.

This program was forked from jakibaki's hid-mitm, and a huge thank you to him and the rest of the AtlasNX discord server for helping this program out
